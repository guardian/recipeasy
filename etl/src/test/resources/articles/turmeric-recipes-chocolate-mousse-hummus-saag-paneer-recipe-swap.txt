<p>As a powder, turmeric is by far the prettiest spice out there, which is a good thing, because six recipes later, my kitchen, and all my kitchen tools, are indelibly stained a bright persimmon orange.</p> <p>Turmeric is part of the ginger family. Plants have lush, waxy leaves and many dark pink flowers arranged in a stack, pineapple style. It can be dried and ground, pickled, grated and boiled, both in sweet and savoury situations.</p> <p>Cooking with the fresh rhizome – more slender than ginger’s knobbly girth, and altogether bolder in colour – was revelatory. When first cut, the juice coats your knife with a glue that’s as persistent as the ink it yields. And it’s really fruity, in a way that the spice in powdered form simply does not prepare you for.</p> <h2>The winning recipe: Chocolate mousse with turmeric and orange</h2> <p>The surprising success of turmeric in a sweet! Chilli and chocolate might be a known quantity, but <a href="https://witness.theguardian.com/user/Fadime"><em>Fadime Tiskaya</em></a>’s addition of the golden root takes it somewhere entirely new. It’s fruity, crunchy, juicy and as spiced as hot sauce.<br /></p> <p><strong>Serves 4-6</strong><br /><strong>For the syrup</strong><br />30ml water<br />45g caster sugar<br />Peel of 1 orange, thinly sliced<br />10g fresh turmeric, peeled and finely chopped</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/30/turmeric-recipes-aubewrgine-onion-rings-pickle-fish-curry-yotam-ottolenghi">Look on the bright side: Yotam Ottolenghi’s turmeric recipes</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>For the mousse</strong><br />175g dark chocolate, broken into pieces<br />5g fresh turmeric, grated<br />½ tsp ground turmeric<br />¼ tsp cayenne pepper<br />3 large eggs, separated<br />3 tbsp caster sugar<br />1 tbsp icing sugar, sifted<br />175g double cream<br />Fresh cherries, stoned, to serve</p> <p>1 For the syrup, put the water and sugar in a small pan and bring to the boil until the sugar dissolves completely. On a low heat, add the orange peels and turmeric, let it boil for about 5 minutes, then set aside.</p> <p>2 Put a heatproof bowl over a pan with simmering water in it, ensuring that the bottom of the bowl doesn’t touch the water. Put the chocolate into the bowl, add your fresh and ground turmeric, as well as the cayenne pepper, and let it all melt together.</p> <p>3 Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks with caster sugar until smooth. In a separate bowl whisk the egg whites with the icing sugar until it’s stiff.</p> <p>4 Turn the heat down under the chocolate, add the egg yolks and quickly whisk until combined and the mix has a thick consistency, then add the double cream and continue to whisk.</p> <p>5 Next, add the syrup and whisk to combine. Take off the heat and fold in the egg whites, then pour into individual serving bowls. Let it rest in the fridge for 30-60 minutes, add your cherries and serve.</p> <h2><strong>Channa dal hummus</strong></h2> <p>Eating this, you do wonder why <a href="https://witness.theguardian.com/user/ColonialCravings"><em>ColonialCravings</em></a>’s innovative twist isn’t the default setting for a tub of the chickpea classic: these are naturally kindred flavours.<br /></p>  <figure class="element element-image element--supporting" data-media-id="9d5d268c66ce85825f000c9655706faf0db6d1f7"> <img src="https://media.guim.co.uk/9d5d268c66ce85825f000c9655706faf0db6d1f7/0_0_551_640/430.jpg" alt="Colonial Cravings’ channa dal hummus – but spiced with turmeric." width="430" height="500" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Colonial Cravings’ channa dal hummus – but spiced with turmeric.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: ColonialCravings/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Serves 4 </strong><br />½ red onion, diced<br />2 tbsp olive oil<br />1 garlic clove, crushed<br />2 tsp fresh ginger, grated<br />½ tsp chilli flakes<br />¼ tsp ground turmeric<br />¼ tsp kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)<br />¼ tsp ground cumin<br />½ tsp mustard seeds<br />1 tomato, diced<br />400g tin of chickpeas, drained<br />Salt and lemon juice, to taste</p> <p>1 Gently fry the onion in a little of the olive oil until it is tender and starting to colour.

Turmeric and poultry, or <em>ayam kunyit</em>, is a pairing that always works, especially in this umami, Asian setting.<br /></p> <p><strong>Serves 3-4</strong><br />8 chicken legs <br />3cm piece of fresh turmeric, finely chopped (or 2 tsp ground turmeric)<br />2 tbsp soy sauce<br />1 tsp light brown sugar<br />A pinch of salt<br />½ tsp black pepper<br />1 red onion, chopped<br />3-4 tbsp vegetable oil, for frying</p> <p>1 Make sure the chicken pieces are dry - pat them with paper kitchen towel to remove any excess moisture.</p> <p>2 Combine the turmeric with the soy sauce, sugar, salt and pepper. Rub the mixture over the chicken pieces. Sprinkle with the chopped onion, then stir well to combine. Set aside to marinate for at least 30 minutes at room temperature.</p> <p>3 Heat 3-4 tbsp oil in a wok or large frying pan over a high heat.

Fry the dusted paneer in the oil until browned, then drain for a couple of minutes on kitchen roll.</p> <p>3 Once the sauce cooking time is up, add the spinach and fried paneer, with a little water if needed.

Serve with rice or chapatis.</p> <h2><strong>Turmeric potatoes with spinach</strong></h2> <p><em>David Nelson</em> roasts the grated rhizome in oil, which allows the colour to get to work beautifully.

Cut the potatoes into large pieces and cook in a deep pan of salted water till approaching tender. Drain in a colander. Give them a slight shake. Put them in a bowl and add the shallots.</p> <p>2 Mix together the ground turmeric, paprika, chilli flakes, ground cumin and garlic, then sprinkle over the potatoes and shallots. Mix slowly and gently with a large spoon.</p> <p>3 Add 1 tbsp of the groundnut oil to a pan and throw in the grated fresh turmeric, mustard and coriander seeds. Put in the oven for 10 minutes.</p> <p>4 Remove the baking tray. Spoon the seeds to one side, then gently add the potatoes and shallots. Spoon the seeds over the potatoes and add the remaining groundnut oil.</p> <p>5 Sprinkle with sea salt flakes, to taste, and return the tray to the oven until golden and crisp.</p> <p>6 Put the spinach in a pan with the lid on a medium heat for 1-2 minutes or just until it wilts. Remove the spinach from the heat and gently toss it with the potatoes and shallots. Add 1 tbsp yoghurt and some torn coriander and serve.A</p>
