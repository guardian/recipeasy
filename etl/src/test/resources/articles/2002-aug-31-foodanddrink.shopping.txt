<p>The common onion is without doubt one of the most important vegetables on earth, having being cultivated for thousands of years. During 2575-2130BC, onions were even used as religious offerings and placed on altars. It is known from mummified remains that they were used in preparing the dead for burial, being placed around the chest and eyes, against the ears and alongside the feet and legs, and even around the pelvis. </p> <p>But despite such a long and distinguished history, some age-old questions remain. Why, for example, do onions produce tears? And why, when cut, do they have a different flavour? </p> <p>An onion is 90% water, held in a weak network of cellulose. This cellulose, in turn, consists of a smaller network of cells, which support and keep separate a whole variety of chemicals, most importantly a range of sulphur compounds. When the onion is cut, these cells are crushed and the exposure to air activates an enzyme that goes to work on the chemicals, creating reactions that give the smell we associate with raw onion. These reactions also release allicin, the volatile substance that goes up the nose, producing tears. </p> <p>Because these substances are both water-soluble and heat-sensitive, the tear-producing property of the onion can be reduced, or even eliminated, by peeling and chopping it under running water, or by chilling it in the fridge or freezer before handling. </p> <p>The so-called sweet onions are more expensive than the common or garden variety, but the name is a misnomer because they don&apos;t actually contain any more sugar. Their sweetness comes from the fact that they are lower in sulphur compounds. It&apos;s pointless cooking a sweet onion, because as soon as it is cooked, or even washed after being cut, a regular onion will have more sweetness. You can sweeten onions even more by rinsing them in vinegar: the acetic acid in it will mask the remaining sulphur compounds. </p> <p> All recipes serve four. </p> <p><strong> Onion purée</strong><br /> </p> <p> This is a simplified version of the purée we serve in the restaurant with saddle of lamb. We make a lamb broth in which to cook the onions, but for the dish here you can use chicken wings in the cooking water. You need meat in this dish, because the onions cook while the liquid is reducing, and end up coated in a thick, syrupy liquid, which would not happen without the meaty content. This also guarantees that the purée is not too wet. The sweating of the onions with the star anise accentuates the meaty notes, and almost acts as a flavour enhancer for the meat. </p> <p><strong> 1 kg onions, peeled </strong></p> <p><strong>150g unsalted butter </strong></p> <p><strong>3 star anise </strong></p> <p><strong>2 litres water </strong></p> <p><strong>500g chicken wings, blanched </strong></p> <p><strong>150ml double cream</strong> </p> <p>Slice the onions very thinly. Place the rings in a pan and pour in cold water to cover. Bring to the boil and simmer for two minutes. Drain and refresh under cold water. </p> <p>Place half the butter, the star anise and the blanched onions in a large casserole. Place on a medium heat and sweat for 10-15 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the two litres of water and the chicken wings, bring to the boil, turn down the heat and simmer. The liquid should have reduced down to a syrup after three hours. If it is reducing too quickly, add some more cold water and lower the heat. After three hours, if you are still left with some excess liquid, increase the heat and reduce until only a little liquid remains. Leave to cool, then remove the star anise and the chicken, and liquidise. Pass the resulting purée through a fine-mesh sieve or, for a more rustic finish, leave just as it is. </p> <p>To serve, stir in cream to taste, whisk in the remaining butter and season - it will take a lot of salt, but this salting is important because it balances out any bitter flavours. </p> <p><strong> Malik&apos;s onion bhajee</strong><br /> </p> <p> I am often asked what and where I eat when I am not at work. Well, once a week I get a takeaway from Malik&apos;s in Cookham, possibly my favourite restaurant. Malik and Mujib run a fantastic joint, and in fact cooked one of my most memorable dinners when I ate there with my friend Harold McGee - we began by tucking into these onion bhajees, the recipe for which Malik has kindly given me. </p> <p><strong> 6 large onions </strong></p> <p><strong>2 small potatoes </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp chilli powder </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp turmeric powder </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp masur dal (red lentils, soaked) </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp salt </strong></p> <p><strong>2 tbsp finely chopped coriander </strong></p> <p><strong>1 large pinch dhania powder (ground coriander seed) </strong></p> <p><strong>1 large pinch jeera powder (ground cumin) </strong></p> <p><strong>2 eggs </strong></p> <p><strong>2 heaped tsp gram flour</strong> </p> <p>Slice the onions and potatoes, and put them in a big bowl. Excluding the gram flour, add all the other ingredients to the bowl (adding the eggs last) and mix well. Sieve the gram flour over the top, then mix again, making sure that the onions are well coated. </p> <p>Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer to a medium heat. Roll the onion mix into balls and place in the fryer. Cook until golden brown (to make sure the bhajees are cooked through, turn over during frying). </p> <p><strong> Dried onion slices</strong><br /> </p> <p> Although quite strong in taste on their own, these onion crisps go really well with the onion purée. They can also be eaten as a snack, or as a garnish for salads, roasted meats and all manner of other dishes. </p> <p><strong> 1 red onion </strong></p> <p><strong>100ml white-wine vinegar </strong></p> <p><strong>1 level dssp icing sugar</strong> </p> <p>Pre-heat the oven to 60C (that&apos;s around gas mark ). Peel and slice the onion as thinly as possible. </p> <p>In a big pot, bring 500ml of water and the vinegar to the boil. Once boiling, drop in the onion rings, bring back to the boil and cook for two minutes. Drain, refresh under cold water, then spread out on kitchen paper and leave to dry. After an hour, lay out the onions on a sheet of parchment paper over a roasting tray, making sure that they do not overlap and that they are lying flat. </p> <p>Sieve the icing sugar over the onions, then transfer the tray to the oven to continue the drying process. The length of time taken to dry them will vary. Allow a couple of hours, but keep an eye on them. When the onions are ready, they will still be slightly soft. Once removed from the oven, they will crisp up </p> <p> <strong>·</strong> Heston Blumenthal is chef/ proprietor of The Fat Duck, Bray, Berkshire (<a href="http://www.thefatduck.co.uk">www.thefatduck.co.uk)</a>.</p>
