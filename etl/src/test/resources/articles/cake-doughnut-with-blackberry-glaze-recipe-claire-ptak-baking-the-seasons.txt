<p>Blackberries that grow wild near hedgerows and along canals, rivers and streams are the things of fairy tales. When you chance upon them it is always a thrill. Free food! Whether a shade of under-ripe red or fermenting on the vine, slightly bland or even muddy, one thing’s for sure: the flavour of the berries at arm’s reach are rarely as good as the ones the birds or the annoying guy with the ladder can reach. There are, however, always a handful of gems among the brambles which, mixed in with the others, are perfect for puddings. Foraging for them in the outdoors – in the city or country – makes them taste all the sweeter.</p> <p>The geranium is a good friend of the blackberry. In fact, geranium is everyone’s friend, because it is so easy to grow. I have one in a tiny pot on my window ledge – next to other easy-growing aromatics, such as thyme, sage, rosemary and bay – which has survived almost a decade. The scented geranium I like best is rose, but the lemon variety is nice for baking too. (A friend even gave me one that smells like Coca-Cola, but I have yet to try it). Infused into cream and mixed into mashed berries, this is the world’s simplest ice-cream to make, but it needs to be eaten on the day, as it will go icy fast.</p> <p>Made into a purple glaze, blackberries are also great on my favourite style of doughnut, the old-fashioned cake variety. Adding lemon and sugar to the berries in a frozen cream or crackly glaze elevates your foraged bounty or supermarket score to a thing of wicked beauty.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="70e40baa4d77bf81e65c16f64f8a95b92c1ef7b4"> <img src="https://media.guim.co.uk/70e40baa4d77bf81e65c16f64f8a95b92c1ef7b4/0_0_2989_4200/712.jpg" alt="The geranium is a good friend of the blackberry – try it mixed into this icy blackberry cream." width="712" height="1000" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">The geranium is a good friend of the blackberry – try it mixed into this icy blackberry cream.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Kristen Perers for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Frozen blackberry-geranium cream</strong></h2> <p><strong>Makes around 2 litres</strong><br />5 geranium leaves, rinsed, slightly torn<br />400g double cream<br />200g caster sugar<br />1.5kg blackberries</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Add the geranium leaves to the cream along with 50g of caster sugar. Allow them to steep overnight in the fridge.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> The next day, macerate the berries in the remaining 150g caster sugar for an hour to extract some juices and sweeten the berries. Whizz the berries and any juices in a food processor or mash with a wooden spoon or mallet.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Strain out the leaves and lightly whip the cream. Fold in the berry mash.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Transfer to a suitably sized container and freeze for at least 4 hours.</p> <h2><strong>Blackberry cake doughnuts</strong></h2> <p>The dough can be made the day before.</p> <p><strong>Makes 6</strong><br />640g extra fine sponge flour<br />3 tsp baking powder<br />A grating of nutmeg<br />2 tsp fine sea salt<br />Zest of 2 lemons<br />200g butter<br />200g sugar<br />4 egg yolks<br />300g plain yoghurt<br />Vegetable oil, for frying</p> <p><strong> For the glaze</strong><br />300g blackberries<br />1 tsp lemon juice<br />400g icing sugar<br />½ tsp salt<br />Hot water</p> <p><strong>1</strong> First, make the doughnut dough. Sift together the flour and baking powder. Whisk in the nutmeg, salt and lemon zest. Set aside.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> In the bowl of a stand mixer or with a handheld electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar – but only until smooth and creamy; not pale and fluffy. Add the yolks one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the yoghurt and mix well.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, and mix them into a dough. Turn out on to a piece of clingfilm. Wrap and chill the dough for 2 hours.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--supporting"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/30/roasted-peaches-recipe-claire-ptak">Claire Ptak’s recipes for roasted peaches served two ways | Baking the seasons</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>4</strong> On a liberally floured surface, roll the dough out to 2cm thick, and cut out as many doughnuts as you can using a 9cm round cutter. Pat the scraps together and re-roll one more time to get about 6 doughnuts all together. Remove the holes, and fry and glaze them as you do the doughnuts. Score lines on top of each doughnut in a pentagonal pattern.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Heat the vegetable oil to 180C/350F. Fry the doughnuts for 4-5 minutes on one side (until golden), and then for 2‑3 minutes on the second side, or until equally golden.</p> <p><strong>6</strong> To make the glaze, puree the blackberries in a food processor. Strain through a sieve to remove the seeds. Mix with the lemon juice, then add the icing sugar and salt, and whisk to combine. If the glaze is a little thick, you can add a drop of hot water.</p> <p><strong>7</strong> Dip the warm doughnuts into the glaze, then put on a wire rack to cool with a tray underneath to catch the drips.</p> <ul> <li><em>Claire Ptak is a pastry chef, author and food stylist and owns Violet Bakery in London.
